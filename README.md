# Lottery

1. Simple Lottery
 
 The bets made by the participants will be converted into a random hash and the play is only 1 time so it will only have a 1 winner. 1 transaction per 1 player and they don't need to bet a number or combinations of number just to be in a bet.
  
 In Ethereum
 Every ticket is worth 0.01n ether and after the contract is deployed, there is a certain amount of time programmed for it to close too. Once closed, any transactions will never be counted or accepted. 5 minutes after closing, the contract deployer can pick the winner in the system from all the participants randomly and the price depends to how many players are present there.
