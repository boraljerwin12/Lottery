# Lottery

   1. Simple Lottery
 
 The bets made by the participants will be converted into a random hash and the play is only 1 time so it will only have a 1 winner. 1 transaction per 1 player and they don't need to bet a number or combinations of number just to be in a bet.
  
   •In Ethereum

Every ticket is worth 0.01n ether and after the contract is deployed, there is a certain amount of time programmed for it to close too. Once closed, any transactions will never be counted or accepted. 5 minutes after closing, the contract deployer can pick the winner in the system from all the participants randomly and the price depends to how many players are present there.
 
   In Hyperledger
 It is also the same that there'll going to have a time duration for executing the program but the difference is that, the participants will have a chaincode for them in order to play. The thing here is that Hyperledger is a private blockchain so you should have to be in a certain group in hyperledger, we can say that only a specific area are able to do things inside of a certain program.
 And all of the other things are the same with ethereum such as how to play, the program running and buying tickets.
 
 
   2. Recurring Lottery
 
 Recuring Lottery is a continuous lottery game. One game after another when having a winner in that certain game and everyone can repeatedly enter this lottery either you won last round or you lose. It will continue not unless the program deployer stops it.
 
   In Ethereum
 The game is divided into 2 processes, 1 is about the lottery deployer and the other is for the players. The deployer's process starts after starting the program. The game will have a specific durations of games depends to how many games the deployers will give. Then there will be a duration for the next round because of checking the winner and it will be notified in deployer's side. The deployer have a choice either to delete or keep the data on that certain game.
